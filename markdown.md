# Why Elementary School Students Should Get Candy Everyday h1

## Introduction h2

Elementary school students need to get more candy or treats that what they are recieving. Those nasty school lunches should have at least a saving grace. They should only recieve those treats after they finish their food, however, the reward of the candy should be encouraging. 

### I believe that a standard lunch should include: h3

*A main course
*Some sort of side dish
*A vegtable or fruit
*A small piece of candy, like a fun sized one, and a sort of dessert, like a small cup of pudding
*A drink of sorts, like milk or juice

Some of the reasons that I believe students deserve more candy or treats are:
1. They will be happier during lunch, and also after lunch
1. They will be more willing to go to lunch, and pay for the given meals at the school
1. They will also be more willing to eat their food for the reward 
1. And the kids will also be able to try new treats that they might not get elsewhere
