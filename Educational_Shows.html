<h1>Why Educational Shows are Benefical for Children</h1>
</header>
<body>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Nowadays a lot of parents are letting their chilren what television shows that aren't educational. There's nothing wrong with a couple non-educational shows, however, I believe that parents should show their children educational shows alongside those other shows.</p>
<h2>Reason 1</h2>
<p>The first reason I believe parents should show their kids educational shows is because they will be able to learn while doing something fun. There were many times where I learned things from shows that I didn't quite get from the classroom.</p>
<h2>Reason 2</p>
<p>The second reason I believe that parents should show their kids educational shows is because their kids will be able to continue learning all day instead of just during school. This is particularly applicible for children who aren't quite yet old enough to attend school, for they can still learn at home.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Throughout this essay, I talked about how kids can learn much from educational shows, and how they can continue to learn outside of the classroom because of these programs. I believe that parents should show their children educational television shows.</p>
